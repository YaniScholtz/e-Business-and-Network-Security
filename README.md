# Computer-Engineering-Crypto-Systems
This repository contains two practical projects completed for the **Computer Engineering: e-Business and Network Security** course.  
Both projects focus on cryptographic systems including Playfair, Hill, Row Transposition, AES, DES, and RC4 ciphers.

## Practical Projects

### Prac 1: Playfair, Hill, and Row Transposition Ciphers

**Folder:** `Practical1`

**Goal:**  
Implement encryption and decryption algorithms for the Playfair cipher (text and image), Hill cipher (text and image), and Row Transposition cipher.

**File:**
- **22510657_Prac_1.py** — Python implementation of Playfair, Hill, and Row Transposition ciphers with helper functions.

---

### Prac 2: AES, DES, and RC4 Ciphers

**Folder:** `Practical2/`

**Goal:**  
Implement encryption and decryption for AES, DES, and RC4 ciphers for both text and images.

**File:**
- **u22510657_Prac_2.py** — Python implementation of AES, DES, and RC4 ciphers including key generation, preprocessing, and decryption functions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- Access to AES and DES arrays (`AES_Arrays/`, `DES_Arrays/`) if needed for encryption and decryption.
